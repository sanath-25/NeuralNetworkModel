# NeuralNetworkModel
Proved that Accuracy of training a heavy workload with high precision and low precision data format is almost similar. By benchmarking this activity on training various workloads proved the fact that the capacity of hardware can be reduced to a great scale when compared to existing utility of the hardware for training most of the heavy workload models.

#Worked with MNIST DATA SET
